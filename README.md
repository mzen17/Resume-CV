# Resume
This will be a place where I store latex resume templates. Recently, I lost the CLS latex template I was using for my resume (I had a latex docker image to work on it; somehow the docker volume got deleted), so to avoid this from happening again, I'll store all the templates that I'm using in this repository.

As a place of reference, I'll have a pipeline creating anon-versions of resume and standard resumes.
